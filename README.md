# Belly Button Biodiversity via plotly

## Overview:
We created a dashboard to show the different types of microbes living in each test subject's belly button. The dashboard shows 3 different types of charts: 
bar, bubble, and gauge to better visualize the data.

## Results:
The dashboard provides a unique way to filter the dataset based on the test subject's ID number.
